#Tea Cozy Codecademy Project#

This project was part of Codecademy's Front End Engineer Path; Codecademy provided the design spec, and the goal 
was to carry out the design with Flexbox. The site also needed to be responsive. 

I learned a lot about how to use Flexbox (particularly the difference between columns and rows...yes, that sounds
silly because who doesn't know the difference between a column and a row), and it was helpful to see how Flexbox contributes
to responsive sites. This project also helped reinforce how to use max-width/height for responsiveness.
